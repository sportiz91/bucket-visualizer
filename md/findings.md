## Cursor Learnings

To ensure that your rules take effect in your Cursor IDE settings, you should use the .cursorrules.json file format

The .json extension indicates that the file is in JSON format, which is a standard for configuration files and is likely what the IDE expects.

Here are a few points to consider:

File Naming: Keep the file named as .cursorrules.json. The .json extension is important for the IDE to recognize the file format and parse it correctly.

Location: Make sure that the .cursorrules.json file is placed in the correct directory where the Cursor IDE looks for configuration files. This is typically the root of your project or a specific configuration directory.

Validation: After creating the file, check if the Cursor IDE provides any feedback or validation for the rules defined in the JSON file. This can help ensure that your rules are correctly formatted and recognized.

4. Documentation: Refer to the Cursor IDE documentation for any specific requirements or examples regarding the configuration file. This can provide additional insights into how to structure your rules effectively.
   By following these guidelines, your .cursorrules.json file should work as intended in your Cursor IDE settings.
